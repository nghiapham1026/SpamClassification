# SpamClassification - Programming Assignment #1
### Image of log loss plot is at plot.png

This project implements a logistic regression model using SGD in Python. The model is trained to classify data into two classes. The scripts will output the evaluation metrics for both the training and test sets.

## Scripts

- `LogisticRegression.py`: Python implementation.

## How to use

### Python

Install `matplotlib` for plotting the log loss curve and `NumPy`, `Pandas` for assisting with processing the datasets:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
```

Run the script using Python 3:

```bash
python LogisticRegression.py
```
